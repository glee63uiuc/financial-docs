## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. In your repository, click **"Settings"** (top menu)
2. Scroll down the left sidebar and click **"Pages"** (under "Code and automation")

4. Click **"Save"**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
6. Refresh the page - you'll see a link like:

## Step 5: Access Your App

## Your Permanent Links Will Look Like:

```
https://glee63.github.io/financial-docs/
```

Replace `glee63` with your actual GitHub username.

## Important Notes:

### ✅ What IS Public:
- The app code (HTML file)
- Anyone with the link can see and use the app code

### ✅ What IS Private:
- **Your documents** - stored ONLY in your browser on your device
- **Your photos** - never uploaded to GitHub
- **Your financial data** - stays on YOUR device only

### 🔒 Security:
- Documents are processed by Claude AI (Anthropic) when you upload them
- After processing (extracting text), the data is deleted from Anthropic's servers
- Only YOUR device keeps the documents permanently
- Enable backups to Google Drive for safety

### 📱 Using on Multiple Devices:
- Open the same GitHub Pages link on each device
- Each device will have its own SEPARATE document storage
- Documents DO NOT sync between devices automatically
- To transfer documents: Export from device 1 → Import to device 2

---

## Updating the App Later

If I provide an updated version of the app:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on `index.html`
3. Click the pencil icon (Edit)
4. Delete all content
5. Paste the new code
6. Click "Commit changes"
7. Wait 1-2 minutes for the update to go live

---

## Troubleshooting:

### "Page not found" error
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
- Make sure file is named `index.html` (not `financial-doc-manager.html`)
- Check that you selected `main` branch in Settings → Pages

### "Repository is private" error
- GitHub Pages (free) requires public repositories
- Go to Settings → General → Danger Zone → Change visibility → Make public

### App won't load on iPhone
- Must open in Safari (not Chrome or other browsers)
- Clear Safari cache if needed
- Make sure you have internet connection (first load only)

### Lost the link?
- Go to your repository → Settings → Pages
- The link is displayed at the top
